# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive pagination support to all GET endpoints that return lists of data in the Flownity Backend API. Currently, endpoints like `/api/v1/projects`, `/api/v1/tasks`, and `/api/v1/task-groups` return all records at once, which can lead to performance issues and poor user experience as data grows. This feature will implement consistent, efficient pagination across all list endpoints while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to paginate through large lists of projects, so that I can efficiently load and display data without overwhelming the client or server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request `/api/v1/projects` without pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL return the first page with a default page size of 20 items
2. WHEN I request `/api/v1/projects?page=2&limit=10` THEN the system SHALL return items 11-20 with pagination metadata
3. WHEN I request `/api/v1/projects?limit=50` THEN the system SHALL return the first 50 items if available
4. WHEN I request a page number that exceeds available data THEN the system SHALL return an empty results array with appropriate pagination metadata
5. WHEN pagination parameters are invalid (negative numbers, non-integers) THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with clear validation messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to paginate through large lists of tasks, so that I can efficiently manage task data in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request `/api/v1/tasks` without pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL return the first page with a default page size of 20 items
2. WHEN I request `/api/v1/tasks?page=3&limit=15` THEN the system SHALL return items 31-45 with pagination metadata
3. WHEN I request `/api/v1/tasks/trash` with pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL apply pagination to soft-deleted tasks
4. WHEN the limit exceeds the maximum allowed (100) THEN the system SHALL cap the limit at 100 and include a warning in the response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to paginate through large lists of task groups, so that I can organize and display task groups efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request `/api/v1/task-groups` without pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL return the first page with a default page size of 20 items
2. WHEN I request `/api/v1/task-groups?page=1&limit=25` THEN the system SHALL return the first 25 task groups with complete pagination metadata
3. WHEN I request `/api/v1/task-groups/trash` with pagination THEN the system SHALL apply pagination to soft-deleted task groups
4. WHEN no results are found for a valid page THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with correct pagination metadata showing total count as 0

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent pagination metadata across all endpoints, so that I can build reliable pagination controls in my frontend application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any paginated endpoint returns data THEN the system SHALL include pagination metadata with current page, total pages, total items, page size, and navigation flags
2. WHEN I receive a paginated response THEN the system SHALL include `hasNextPage` and `hasPreviousPage` boolean flags
3. WHEN I receive pagination metadata THEN the system SHALL include `startIndex` and `endIndex` to show the range of items returned
4. WHEN the response format is standardized THEN all paginated endpoints SHALL use the same pagination metadata structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pagination to be implemented efficiently at the database level, so that the system maintains good performance even with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pagination is applied THEN the system SHALL use database LIMIT and OFFSET clauses to fetch only required records
2. WHEN counting total records THEN the system SHALL use efficient COUNT queries that don't fetch unnecessary data
3. WHEN pagination parameters are processed THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize inputs before database queries
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use the existing connection pooling and error handling mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want backward compatibility maintained, so that existing applications continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make requests without pagination parameters THEN the system SHALL return paginated results with default settings rather than all records
2. WHEN existing response structures are maintained THEN the system SHALL add pagination metadata without breaking existing data structures
3. WHEN API versioning is considered THEN the system SHALL implement pagination in the current v1 API without requiring version changes
4. WHEN legacy behavior is needed THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration guidance for applications expecting all records at once
