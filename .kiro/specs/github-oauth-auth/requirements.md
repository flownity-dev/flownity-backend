# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements GitHub OAuth authentication for the Flownity backend using PassportJS with the passport-github2 strategy. The system will allow users to authenticate using their GitHub accounts, store minimal user information in a PostgreSQL database, and provide a simple test interface for authentication flow validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my GitHub account, so that I can securely access the application without creating a separate account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN the system SHALL display a "Login with GitHub" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Login with GitHub" button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to GitHub's OAuth authorization page
3. WHEN a user authorizes the application on GitHub THEN the system SHALL receive an authorization code from GitHub
4. WHEN the system receives a valid authorization code THEN the system SHALL exchange it for an access token
5. WHEN the system receives a valid access token THEN the system SHALL retrieve the user's GitHub profile information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user data to be stored securely in PostgreSQL, so that user sessions can be maintained and user information can be retrieved efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL store their GitHub ID, username, and display name in the PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN a user authenticates for the first time THEN the system SHALL create a new user record in the database
3. WHEN an existing user authenticates THEN the system SHALL update their last login timestamp
4. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL only store minimal required information (GitHub ID, username, display name, created_at, updated_at)
5. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple test route and page, so that I can verify the authentication flow is working correctly during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the root route ("/") THEN the system SHALL render a simple HTML page with login functionality
2. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the page SHALL display a "Login with GitHub" link
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the page SHALL display their GitHub username and a logout option
4. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the login page
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper session management, so that user authentication state is maintained securely across requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL create a secure session
2. WHEN a user makes subsequent requests THEN the system SHALL validate their session
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL destroy their session completely
5. IF session data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that authentication issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details and return a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log the error and return an appropriate error response
3. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL log the issue and fail gracefully
4. WHEN GitHub API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error and inform the user appropriately
5. IF any unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the full error details for debugging
