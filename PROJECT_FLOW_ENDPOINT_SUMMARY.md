# Project Flow Endpoint Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a new endpoint `/api/v1/projects/project-flow/:project_id` that returns consolidated project data with users and their tasks organized by task groups.

## Endpoint Details
- **URL**: `GET /api/v1/projects/project-flow/:project_id`
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer token required
- **Access Control**: Only accessible to project members (project owner or users assigned to tasks)

## Response Structure
The endpoint returns users grouped with their tasks organized by task groups:

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    project_id: number,
    project_title: string,
    users: [
      {
        id: string,
        task_owner: string,
        approvers: string[],
        taskGroups: [
          {
            group_name: string,
            tasks: [
              {
                id: string,
                task_title: string,
                status: string
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Key Features
1. **Task Grouping**: Tasks are organized by their task groups (or "Ungrouped" if no group assigned)
2. **Multiple Approvers**: Each user can have multiple approvers for their tasks
3. **Access Control**: Only project members can access the flow data
4. **Status Integration**: Tasks include their current status from the status table
5. **User Information**: Full names are used when available, falling back to usernames

## Database Changes Made
1. **Updated database schema** (`src/database/init.ts`):
   - Added `flwnty_status` table with default statuses
   - Added `flwnty_project` table
   - Added `flwnty_task_group` table
   - Added `status_id` column to `flwnty_task` table
   - Added proper foreign key relationships
   - Added indexes for performance

2. **Updated Task model** (`src/models/Task.ts`):
   - Added `statusId` property
   - Updated interfaces and methods to handle status

## Files Modified
- `src/controllers/api/projectController.ts` - Added `getProjectFlow` method
- `src/routes/api/v1/projectRoutes.ts` - Added route mapping
- `src/database/init.ts` - Updated database schema
- `src/models/Task.ts` - Added status support
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Added endpoint documentation

## SQL Query Logic
The endpoint uses a complex SQL query that:
1. Joins tasks with task groups, users, and status tables
2. Aggregates approvers for each user across all their tasks in the project
3. Groups results by assignee and task group
4. Handles cases where tasks don't have groups or approvers

## Error Handling
- **401**: User not authenticated
- **400**: Invalid project ID
- **404**: Project not found
- **403**: Access denied (user not a project member)
- **500**: Database errors

## Security Considerations
- JWT authentication required
- Access control based on project membership
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Input validation for project ID parameter
